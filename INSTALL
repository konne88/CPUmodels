* How to build the CPU models?

You will need Coq 8.5pl2.

- install the ocaml package manager opam
- opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
- opam install coq-flocq-2.5.1
- For x86, go to x86model and type make.
- Sorry, but the MIPS model is not up to date to Coq 8.5.
 
* How to build the validation tools? (sorry, haven't checked this for a while;
  it may not working)

First, build the x86 CPU model. Then, you will need OCaml 3.12 (or a more
recent verison), and pin (http://www.pintool.org/). Please go to the
x86model/semantics_trace directory and for further instructions.

* How to build the RockSalt C driver? (sorry, haven't checked this for a while;
  it may not working)

You will need to install the developer version of native client first. Then,
replace the native_client/src/trustaed/validator_x86/ncval.c file with ours,
make sure the include for tables.h and driver.h are properly set, and build
native client as usual. The resulting ncval binary can run RockSalt by
passing the command line ragument --dfa.
